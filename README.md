A space to store stuff i'll make through codevember 2015 on codepen.io.

## Tech

Every pen is made with [Jade](http://www.jade-lang.com) for html, [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Ecmascript2015 to es5 js,
and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for CSS.

Final project is built with gulp and deployed on github-pages.
